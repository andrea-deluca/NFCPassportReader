I would like to point out that the [OpenSSL Swift Package](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/OpenSSL) 
developed by [@krzyzanowskim](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim) has been used to carry out some more complex security operations.

In addition, I would like to mention the [NFCPassportReader](https://github.com/AndyQ/NFCPassportReader) repo 
developed by [@AndyQ](https://github.com/AndyQ). I studied it as well as the ICAO Doc 9303 to be able to develop the NFCPassportReader package.

Lastly, I would like to say that the ASN.1 module has been extracted and manipulated as needed 
from [swift-asn1](https://github.com/apple/swift-asn1) developed by [@apple](https://github.com/apple).
